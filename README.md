# devbox-setup
This repo contains a few scripts that help me setup my local devbox. Geared toward
Ubuntu-flavored distros. I mostly use Ubuntu and/or Mint.

## install.sh

Currently installs the following:

- atom.io editor
- Postgresql along with pgadmin3 (and a few other essentials)
- Pip for python3

Also configures the following:

- virtualenvwrapper bashrc lines
